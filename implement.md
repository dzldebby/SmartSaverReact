Current App Structure:
Frontend (Calculator.js):
Collects user inputs (deposit amount, salary, spending, etc.)
Has basic and advanced requirement sections
Currently calls calculateResults() which uses calculateInterest()
Backend (calculations.js):
Has individual calculation functions for each bank
Uses a bank configuration from somewhere (not shown in the code)
Integration Plan:
A. Phase 1: Core Optimization Engine
Create a new module optimizationEngine.js that will:
Take the same inputs currently used in Calculator.js
Implement the DP algorithm for distribution optimization
Return top 3 scenarios with detailed breakdowns
Modify calculations.js to:
Keep existing bank calculation functions
Add a new export for the optimization function
Ensure consistent interest calculation across all distribution scenarios
B. Phase 2: Data Structure Updates
Create a bankConfig.js file to store:
Bank configurations (rates, caps, requirements)
Interest calculation rules
Bonus conditions
Make it easily maintainable
Start with these banks first:
UOB One
OCBC 360
SC BonusSaver
BOC SmartSaver
Chocolate
C. Phase 3: UI Updates
Add a new tab/section in the UI for "Optimize Distribution"
Create new components:
OptimizationResults.js: Display top 3 scenarios
DistributionBreakdown.js: Show detailed breakdown
ComparisonView.js: Compare different scenarios
Update the UI to show:
Distribution visualization (pie chart)
Interest breakdown per bank
Total interest earned
Comparison with single-bank scenarios
D. Phase 4: API Integration
Create new API endpoints:
/api/optimize: Calculate optimal distribution
/api/compare: Compare with single-bank scenarios
Update the server to:
Handle optimization requests
Cache results for similar scenarios
Validate inputs
Implementation Order:
First: Create bankConfig.js and optimize core bank calculations
Second: Implement the DP optimization algorithm
Third: Build the UI components for displaying results
Fourth: Connect everything through API endpoints
Technical Considerations:
Keep the $5,000 increment for practical distribution
Maintain current input validation and formatting
Ensure error handling for edge cases
Keep performance in mind for larger amounts
Make the code maintainable and testable
Would you like me to proceed with any specific part of this plan? We can start with either:
Creating the bank configuration structure
Building the optimization algorithm
Designing the UI components
Setting up the API endpoints
Let me know which part you'd like to tackle first, and I'll provide a detailed implementation plan for that specific component.
